# Customizable FizzBuzz Project

This project implements the classic FizzBuzz problem using Java programming language. In addition to the standard FizzBuzz implementation, this project allows the user to input any number, and the FizzBuzz logic executes up to that number.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine
- Any Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

3. Build and run the project.

## Usage

1. After running the project, the application prompts the user to enter a number.
2. Enter any positive integer number and press Enter.
3. The program will then execute the FizzBuzz logic up to the entered number and display the results in the console.

## Implementation Details

- The FizzBuzz logic is implemented in the `FizzBuzz1.java` and `FizzBuzz2.java` files found in the `com.amalitech` package.
- The user input and main execution logic are implemented in the main method.
